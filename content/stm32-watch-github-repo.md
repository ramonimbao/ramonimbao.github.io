After two years, I've finally moved my DIY STM32 Watch project files into its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ramonimbao/stm32_watch). Included are the hardware: FreeCAD source files, STL files, KiCAD project, gerber files, and the software: SW4STM32 project files. I've also managed to move the instructions I originally posted in the [Hackaday.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/20777-stm32l0-watch) into a markdown file in the repository. Check the repository out for more information!
