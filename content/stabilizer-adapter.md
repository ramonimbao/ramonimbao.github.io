I've had some PCB-mount stabilizers that I haven't been able to use since I've only been handwiring my mechanical keyboard projects. For my latest one, I wanted to make use of these, so I 3D printed an adapter that'll let me do so.

## Description

Simply mount the stabilizer on it as you would on a PCB. Two M2 holes allow it to be attached to the plate you're mounting your switches to. It also has cutouts around the bottom for wires, and requires no support to print.
