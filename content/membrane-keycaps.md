## Note

This was originally posted to [/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bvwynd/membrane_keycap_conversion/) three months ago. I am simply reposting this now to my personal blog.

## Description

{{ image(src="/images/membrane-keycaps/result.jpg" description="Image source: https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/intex-corona-keyboard-12812562212.html") }}

This is what I started out with:an Intex Corona membrane keyboard. I forgot to take a photo before I removed the keycap, so here's a stock image I grabbed off Google. The keyboard features those Big-Ass Enter keys and a 1u |\ key which is the reason for the mismatched keycaps in the first image.

The upper row is a bit smaller than 1u so I didn't bother removing those. The missing Pause/Break keycap was for me to test out the durability of the legends. The legends are simply printed on, but it took me and a knife to remove it, so I guess it's durable enough?

Definitely not Cherry MX compatible. All the keycaps also have a uniform profile, and is only 5.4mm tall without the stem.

I trimmed the plastic away with a flush cutter and filed it. THe plastic is quite thin at 1mm so it wasn't difficult to work with at all.

I designed all of them in Fusion 360. Since the keycaps are all uniform profile, it was easy to design and work with. I used cheap noname PLA to print these.

I used superglue to mount these. The bottom of the stem is flush with the bottom of the keycap. Then it's just a matter of doing this for all the keycaps I needed, and placing it on the switch. Fit is a bit tighter than usual, but I think that's me overextruding with the black PLA I used.

Overall, it was a fun experiment. The keycaps aren't as tall as I like, and I prefer the sleek and sexy look of my blank black PBT keycaps, but at least my girlfriend can finally try my keyboard out without complaining where specific keys are. (Maybe I should teach her how to touch type?)

Someone in the comments asked for the STLs, so I put them up along with the Fusino 360 source in [this repository](https://github.com/ramonimbao/iNTEX_Key_Adapter) under the MIT license.
