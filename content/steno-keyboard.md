I finally finished my 3D printed, handwired stenography keyboard for use with [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/).

It uses the [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) running on an Arduino Pro Micro clone, and communicates with Plover with the TX Bolt protocol. It uses Gateron black switches, and has custom DSA-style keycaps.

I learned how to route my wires like this from Ben Heck. "Always build something you can take apart," or something like that.

I'd say I did a pretty good job with the wiring.

The top plate and the bottom plate are held together with 15 M2Ã—10 screws. Seems excessive, but whatever. I could've reduced it by simply not making the sides exposed and adding walls, but I like the open sides aesthetic so you can see my wiring.

It took me over 5 minutes just to screw all the screws. An electric screwdriver is probably the next tool I'll be buying.

The custom DSA-style keycaps were based off [this repository by Rozakiin](https://github.com/Rozakiin/DSA-MX) ([licensed MIT](https://github.com/Rozakiin/DSA-MX/blob/master/LICENSE)). I modified the models so it's easier for me to 3D print, as well as adding the legends. The black you see is permanent marker. I don't think it will rub off easily because it's 0.6 mm below the top face.

How well does it work? I don't know yet, but this is the first time for me to try linear switches and they feel good to press. It is a bit weird for me to not hear a very tactile *click* like with blue switches.

Currently, I average around 100 WPM. My goal for this steno keyboard is to double that.
