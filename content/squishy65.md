## Description

I ran this as a local group buy with over 90 participants last year. I was still able to fulfill all the units despite delays.

## Layout

Buyers had two options for the GB: with blocker or no blocker. If I remember correctly, only three people actually chose having no blocker while everyone else chose blocker. A few also had special requests (engraving, upper right key blocker, 2u blocker, a completely different case design).
