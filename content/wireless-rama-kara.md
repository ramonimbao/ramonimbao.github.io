I made a wireless replacement PCB for the RAMA Kara.

## Description

I hadn't tested if this would work with the internal dampener or with the internal weight. There's quite a bit of space inside but probably not enough for the battery.

I also actually messed up the routing for the underglow. I've fixed it in another revision of the PCB but I hadn't ordered them. Maybe when Kara SEQ2 starts shipping.

Since it's a wireless PCB, I added a wittwe eastew egg.
