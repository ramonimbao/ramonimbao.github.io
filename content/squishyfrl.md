If you take the [SquishyTKL](/squishytkl) and chop off the F-row, you get the SquishyFRL.

I mean, that's also exactly how I did the PCB layout; I just deleted the F-row and rerouted a few things and I was done!

Just like with the SquishyTKL, the bottom layer has been replaced with a stainless steel plate, giving the board some heft and rigidity.

And just like the SquishyTKL, the SquishyFRL has two PCBs and two plates. And with the way it's laid out, you can build it normally or as a southpaw keyboard! The photos feature both configurations.
