This is a TKL PCB I made for the Frog keyboard. Now if only I can get a Frog.

The PCB features a breakable USB connector, an ai03 daughterboard connector, F12/F13 layout support, and a top-side USB.

Besides the F12/F13 support, there's a whole lot of layout options as well - just like with my other PCBs.
