This is a wireless 60% PCB I made. Featuring the [hineybush h60](https://hineybush.com/collections/july-2021-restock/products/h60-group-buy) outline so it can be drop-in for different keyboards.

## Description

The entire BLErry series of boards is dedicated to me and my girlfriend's dog [Berry](https://www.instagram.com/berry_theyorkie/).

V1 had MX only. The silkscreen for Berry's art came out pretty bad.

V2 fixes this. I changed from square pixels to round dots for the art.
