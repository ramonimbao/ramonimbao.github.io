I made a Bakeneko 70 based on the Bakeneko 60.

## Description

Since the [bakeneko-60 by kkatano](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60) is open source, I grabbed the model for the case and edited it to accommodate an additional F-row. I had to modify the PCB as well to add the extra row.

I am personally not a fan of tight layouts so I opted to add blockers for the F-row. The blockers mount to the plate, hence the gaps.

I wanted to test out [PCBway*](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=25205)'s CNC machining capabilities. I have tested it before, but I stupidly made a case that wasn't bead blasted. This Bakeneko 70 is the real test for it. All I can say is it definitely isn't for running group buys.

I will be open sourcing the files once I'm happy with the design.
