This is a keyboard I designed for [The Keyboard Spa](https://www.facebook.com/TheKeyboardSpa/). It's a [Maja](https://kbdfans.com/products/coming-soon-vulcan-x-kbdfans-maja-mechanical-keyboard-diy-kit) layout keyboard with wireless functionality running [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev)!

## Description

The Keyboard Spa is the one that facilitated the group buy for this. Only twenty units ran as of 29 July 2021 in two rounds (two rounds of 10 boards each). A third round should be soon!

This was my first foray into designing a wireless PCB. All of the schematics are from ebastler's [ZMK Design Guide](https://github.com/ebastler/zmk-designguide). I'm glad this was a success as it paved way to many more wireless boards for RMI-KB.
